## :octocat: I want to contribute!

That's great!

Here are some basic rules to get you started:
Commits should start with a Capital letter and should be written in present tense (e.g. **:tada: Add cool new feature** instead of **:tada: Added cool new feature**).
You should also start your commit message with **one** applicable emoji.
This does not only look great but also makes you rethink what to add to a commit. Make many but small commits!
